Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark:
    This project demonstrates basic usage of Wireshark, a powerful open-source network protocol analyzer. It is widely used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software       and protocol development, and education. The purpose of this exercise is to capture, filter, and analyze network traffic in order to understand how different protocols       operate in real time.

About Wireshark:
    Wireshark is a tool that allows users to inspect network traffic at a granular level. It provides visibility into the data traveling through a network, helping users        diagnose issues, detect anomalies, or simply learn how network protocols work.

Hereâ€™s what Wireshark does:
  Captures live network traffic from active interfaces.
  Displays detailed information for each packet (protocols, source/destination, flags, etc.).
  Allows filtering of packets by protocol, IP address, port, and more.
  Supports exporting and importing packet captures in .pcap format.
  Helps identify various network protocols such as TCP, DNS, HTTP, and more.
