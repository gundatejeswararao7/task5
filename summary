Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that lets you capture and interactively examine the data traveling through a computer network. It is one of the most essential tools for network troubleshooting, protocol development, and cybersecurity analysis.

What Wireshark Can Do
1)Capture live network traffic from various interfaces (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.).
2)Inspect individual packets at a very detailed level (headers, payloads, etc.).
3)Filter packets by protocol, IP address, port, or other parameters.
4)Analyze communication between devices using protocols like HTTP, TCP, DNS, ARP, and many more.
5)Reconstruct TCP streams to view entire conversations (e.g., HTTP requests/responses).
6)Resolve domain names and IP addresses from captured DNS traffic.
7)Detect anomalies or malicious activity in network traffic.
8)Export capture data to .pcap files for sharing or further analysis.
9)Visualize protocol hierarchy, endpoints, and conversations.
10)Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
